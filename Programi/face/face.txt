DESCRIPTION:

An animated three-dimensional face showing different facial expressions, 
acquired using a real-time range camera. The acquisition speed is approximately 
3 frames/sec. The database contains 15 expressions of the same face, represented 
as a textured shape. Each object contains approximately 2000 vertices. 
Two representations are available: MATLAB file (.mat) and ASCII text files 
containing the 1-based list of triangular faces (.tri), a list of vertex XYZ
coordinates (.vert), and a list of [0...1] texture intensity levels (.text). 
A .png thumbnail is available for each object. A MATLAB function for reading 
the data is supplied. 

LICENSE:

This data set is distributed as part of the TOSCA (Toolbox for
Surface Comparison and Analysis) project and may be used for
academic purposes. Any publication using the database should mention
a reference of [1-2] below.
